# Neural networks from scratch
Building simple neural networks without the use of an ML/autodiff library.

Binary classification used to predict whether an image of an item of clothing is a bag or not.

Constructed multiple different networks varying different hyperparameters including number of layers, batch size, momentum, velocity, learning rate. Used grid-search to choose optimal hyperparameters.

Dataset used: “Fashion-MNIST” (Xiao et al., 2017)
